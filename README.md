Live Demo:

Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript. Today we built a split landing page with two sides that dynamically change when you hover over them with your mouse. I'm interested in playing around a bit more and having the effect take place when hover over the button, not just the entire content. Again, we used document.querySelector and it's really coming through how useful and popular this JavaScript tool is, we also used mouseenter and mouseleave for the first time which was cool to see, it looks for where your mouse is on the content and executes the function if so. Fun little project, could be cool for a e-commerce shop or website tracking a product, like PS5's or Xbox's, etc.,
